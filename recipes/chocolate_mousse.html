    <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>This is the recipe for a delicious chocolate mousse that is very easy to make even for beginners.</p>
      <p>But even the most experienced in the kitchen should try this recipe because it is one of the most perfectly textured chocolate mousses I've tried.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces dark chocolate (62% cacao is ideal)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chilled heavy whipping cream</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>  

      <ol>
        <li><strong>First Step</strong></li>
          <p>Break up or chop chocolate into small pieces and set aside with butter.</p>
        
        <li><strong>The second step</strong></li>
          <p>Add egg yolks, sugar, water, and salt to a metal mixing bowl. Cook, whisking, directly over medium-low heat until the mixture is thick, foamy, and hot to the touch (145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 65 degrees C)).</p> 

        <li><strong>The third step</strong></li>
          <p>Once the yolk mixture is thick and hot, add chocolate and butter, and whisk until all chocolate is melted. Let rest for a few minutes on the counter, whisking occasionally to further cool the mixture to just above or at room temperature. The chocolate mixture shouldnâ€™t go into the whipped cream while still warm, but if cooled too long, the mixture may get too firm to fold in.</p>

        <li><strong>The fourth step</strong></li>
          <p>Whisk cold cream until medium stiff peaks form. If cream is whisked further, it will separate and the final texture will be grainy.</p>

        <li><strong>The fifth step</strong></li>  
          <p>Transfer about 1/3 of chocolate mixture into whipped cream, and fold with a spatula until almost incorporated. Gently fold in remaining chocolate, trying to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.</p>
          
        <li><strong>The sixth step</strong></li>  
          <p>Transfer into 4 serving dishes, wrap, and chill before serving, at least 1 hour.</p>
      </ol>
