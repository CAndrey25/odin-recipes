# odin-recipes
This is my first project on github. 18.02.2024 15:34

In this project I will make my first web page and I will test the knowledge gained during the TheOdinProject: Foundation Course.

Today I finished learning all the introductory chapters including HTML FOUNDATON.

In the odin-recipes directory I will create my first index.html page and i fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML Also I will add an h1 heading to the body.

Then I will create a web page with my favorite recipe in the recipe directory.

I will add an image to this page 

I will show the ingredients of the recipe on the page in an unordered list.

I will create an ordered list with the steps that must be followed to get that tasty food.

At the end I will add links to other favorite recipes on the internet.
